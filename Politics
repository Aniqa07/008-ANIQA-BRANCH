Politics is the process through which decisions are made for a group, country, or society.
It involves the creation and enforcement of laws, the management of public resources, and the leadership of people through elected representatives.
Political systems vary across the world, but most aim to maintain order, protect rights, and ensure the well-being of citizens.
While politics can bring progress and development, it can also lead to conflict, especially when power is misused or public interests are ignored.
Overall, politics plays a vital role in shaping the lives of individuals and the future of nations.
